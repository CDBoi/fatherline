        <p><b>Fatherline</b> is an interactive telephone line about fatherhood. It's a living library on which participants can listen to and add short stories.</p>
        <p>Created by artist/designer Jack Hardiker for Manchester International Festival Creative50, Fatherline collates personal stories about fatherhood via the medium of an interactive telephone line. In offering anonymity and a common technology, the project hopes to capture an intimacy and frankness that might be denied in traditional interview forms.</p>
        <p>Fatherline is an open collaborative response to Fatherland: ‘a bold, ambitious show about contemporary fatherhood’ by Scott Graham, Karl Hyde, and Simon Stephens, Fatherland takes inspiration from conversations with fathers and sons from the trio’s hometowns.</p>
        <p>Created by <b>Jack Hardiker</b>. Front-end development: <b>Craig de Gozdawa</b>. Back-end development: <b>Harry Moynehan</b>. Voiceover: <b>Christian Payne</b>. Music: <b>Philip Kay</b>. Text editing; <b>Alex Solo</b> &amp; <b>Alexandra Pereira</b>. Thanks to: <b>Manchester International Festival</b>, <b>Creative50</b>, <b>Nexmo</b>, <b>Tui Interactive Media</b>, and all the Fatherland participants.</p>
